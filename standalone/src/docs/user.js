  <li>Welcome to WWWall, the audio casting utility from <a href="https://wewatchwall.com" target="_blank">We Watch Wall Inc.</a>!</li>
  <li>This web application will synchronize and play your playlists across browser-enabled devices.</li>
  <li>The best browser to use is the <a href="https://brave.com/" target="_blank">Brave Browser</a>. If on mobile, enable the "Background video playback" option. Chrome is also a good alternative.</li>
  <li>First, make sure that your device clock is synchronized to the internet for accuracy.</li>
  <li>Usually, your event organizer will send you a link with a file or a website with a playlist .zip file. <strong>For your security, only download files from trusted websites and email senders.</strong></li>
  <li>If you need to create a playlist, you can check the "Author Info" section of this app, or <a href="https://github.com/WeWatchWall/stark-player/blob/main/standalone/example_playlists/playlist.zip" target="_blank">download the example playlist</a>.</li>
  <li>Unlike other playlists, every device needs to load the example playlist within the same minute.</li>
  <li>When you get to the event, select the file on the "Play" page of the app.</li>
  <li>Then, follow the on-screen instructions.</li>
  </ol>
